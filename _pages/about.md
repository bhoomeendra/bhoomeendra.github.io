Hello there! I am a Research Student at IIIT Hyderabad, working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Law. My primary area of interest is Natural Language Processing (NLP), which involves designing algorithms to help computers understand and interpret human language.

Beyond NLP, I have a keen interest in Mathematics and Philosophy, both of which have helped me to develop a more nuanced and interdisciplinary approach to my work.

One of my passions is teaching, and I love to find ways to make complex concepts easier to understand for others. I believe that everyone can uderstand the hardest concept when we buil it from scratch.

On my website, you can expect to find a range of content related to AI, Law, NLP, Mathematics, and Philosophy.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically. -->
