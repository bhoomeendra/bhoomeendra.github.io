<!-- This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine. You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$. -->

<!-- To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example: -->

<!-- $$\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2$$ -->
